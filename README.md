This is an issue tracking web app created with the MERN stack
Visit the site here: https://bugtracker.noah.et/

The bugtracker lets teams track issues they come across in the software they build. It enables the developers to:
- ✅Track issues by creating tickets
- ✅Add text and images to the ticket to describe the issue
- ✅Tag the issue based on its urgency as low, medium, or high priority

Once the ticket has been added:
- ✅Other developers can suggest solutions by commenting on the ticket
- ✅The developer who created the ticket can edit it if there's an adjustment to be made
- ✅When a solution is found, the developer can mark a comment as the solution
